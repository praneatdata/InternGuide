If you are new to competitive programming or programming in general, here is a structured approach to start your journey:

Learn the Basics:

Begin with a CP handbook to understand the fundamentals of competitive programming.
Practice with InterviewBit:

Start using InterviewBit to solve coding problems and build a strong foundation.
Utilize Online Resources:

For each topic on InterviewBit, find additional resources on YouTube. Search for the specific topic headline and follow tutorials from YouTubers like TakeUForward, LUV, CodeWithHarry, and CodeHelp.
Engage with the videos and solve the problems discussed to gain better clarity.
Effective Learning:

While learning, itâ€™s okay to take help or hints. However, once you start attempting questions, try to time yourself and avoid using hints to improve your problem-solving skills.
Advanced Practice:

After completing the content on InterviewBit, move on to other platforms such as the CSES Problem Set, LeetCode, and PClub Archives to further hone your skills.
